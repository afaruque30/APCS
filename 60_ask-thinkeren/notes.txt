I believe our class failed to sort the cards before the class ended. 
I am pretty sure Mr.Mykolyk is trying to demonstrate what merge sorting looks like, a sorting mechanism that involves a sort of 
binary division/divide and conqueor stragergy. I will try to demonstrate with a list of numbers here, rather than explain it

[1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8, 6, 7]
1) split it in half
[1, 3, 4, 2]       [5, 8, 6, 7]
2) split it again
[1, 3] [4, 2]      [5, 8] [6, 7]
3) again
[1] [3] [4] [2]    [5] [8] [6] [7]
4) begin recollection in ordered fashion (?)
[1, 3] [2,4]       [5, 8]   [6, 7]  
5) recollection again
[1, 2, 3, 4]       [5, 6, 7, 8]
6) final recollection

this basically splits up the work as many times as possible, so its supposedly the most effecient method of sorting.
