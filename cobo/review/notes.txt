Activity 1:
  1a. public static double sentimentVal( String word )
  1b. the parameter has to be a string
  1c. it returns a double. 
  2. sentimentVal("administration"); -> -0.02
     sentimentVal("americans"); -> -0.94
     sentimentVal("computer"); -> 0.15
  3a. It is compilable as a string is passed through the method and a double
  is returned. 

  3b. It is not compilable. doubles don't go ghrough sentimentVal()
  and the return type is not supposed to be a string.
  3c. not compilable since there is more than one argument.
